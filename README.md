## React Official Tutorial Demo in Functional Components Style

This repo is an implementation for react's official demo https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

The official demo composes JavaScript and Class Components style. I rewrite this demo with TypeScript and in the new recommended Functional Components style with hooks, which is introduced in v16.8.x.

You can ref to this video https://youtu.be/dpw9EHDh2bM for an overview of this new style.

Have fun.

Personally, I don't like use 'class' in JavaScript since it's fake, which is just a syntax sugar with prototype chain. Hopefully, with TypeScript it's way more easy for us to do OOP. But for JavaScript, I think it's better to use Objects and Delegate oriented design pattern to avoid using 'class' as much as possible.
